### 5) CEX Listing Pool (1,000,000,000 KCG) – Optional

> This sub-allocation describes how **1B KCG** may be used as an initial pool for CEX listings, campaigns, and market-making.\
> Adjust or publish this section depending on your final listing strategy.

| Category          | Tokens (KCG)      |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Ecosystem         | 250,000,000       |
| Marketing         | 250,000,000       |
| Partner & Advisor | 150,000,000       |
| Team              | 200,000,000       |
| Sale              | 75,000,000        |
| Reserve           | 75,000,000        |
| **Total**         | **1,000,000,000** |

The above 1B KCG is **part of** the main allocations in Section 3 and does not increase the total supply beyond 500B. It simply specifies how much of each allocation may be prepared for centralized exchange (CEX) listing, liquidity, campaigns, and early-stage incentives.
