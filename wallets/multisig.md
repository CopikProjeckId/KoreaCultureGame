  We confirm that the following controls are already implemented and actively
  enforced in our project operations

# Multisig

#### 1) Multisig Control for Token Owner & Major Wallets

* The **Token Owner / Admin** control and all **major project wallets** are managed through **Safe (SafeGlobal) multisig**.
* No single externally-owned account (EOA) has unilateral control over token ownership/admin privileges or major treasury funds.

#### 2) Signature Threshold (≥ 67%)

* Our Safe multisig governance is configured with **CEO / CTO / CFO as 3 signers**.
* Any transaction execution requires **at least 2 approvals (2-of-3)**.
* This corresponds to an approval threshold of **\~66.7% (treated as the ≥ 67% threshold standard)** for all critical treasury actions.

#### 3) Purpose-Based Wallet Segregation (One Wallet, One Purpose)

* We operate under a purpose-based wallet model, maintaining **separate wallets by function** (e.g., Reserve, Ecosystem, Development, Marketing, Team, Private Investors, Advisor).
* We do **not** pool unrelated funds into a single omnibus wallet, except where explicitly disclosed.

#### 4) On-Chain Verifiability

* All multisig approvals and executions are recorded **on-chain** and can be verified via the relevant block explorers.
* The only official source for addresses is our [**Official Address Registry**](../address/mainnet.md) page.
