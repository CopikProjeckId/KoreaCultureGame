# SMG\_TON

#### 1) Purpose of this Disclosure

This page clarifies the nature of the **SMG token on TON** that was used during an early prototype phase, and explicitly states its **non-relationship** to the current **KCG token**.

This disclosure is published as a permanent reference to prevent confusion, misinformation, or incorrect assumptions regarding token continuity, swaps, or entitlements.

***

#### 2) What SMG (TON) Was

* **SMG (TON)** was used only in an **early prototype / experimental environment** to test gameplay flow, reward UX, and basic token interactions.
* SMG was not designed as the official ecosystem token for Korea Culture Game, and it was not intended to represent the final tokenomics, treasury structure, or governance model.

***

#### 3) What KCG Is (Current Official Token)

* The **current official token is KCG on BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**.
* KCG is the only token that represents the current KCG ecosystem utility and published tokenomics.

> Official contract addresses are listed only in the **Official Address Registry**. Any token not listed there is not an official KCG token.

***

#### 4) Explicit Non-Relationship (Important)

To avoid any ambiguity:

* **SMG (TON) is NOT KCG.**
* **SMG (TON) has no swap, migration, conversion, or redemption relationship** with KCG.
* Holding SMG does **not** provide any claim, right, allocation, vesting entitlement, or future distribution of KCG.
* KCG does **not** inherit liquidity, treasury assets, governance rights, or obligations from SMG.

In short: **SMG (TON) was a prototype/testing token only, and is independent from the current KCG token.**

***
