# 🎮 Korea Culture Game

### UX-first onboarding → Points economy → Security & governance

Korea Culture Game is a UX-first gaming ecosystem designed for seamless **Web2-style onboarding** and transparent **on-chain accountability**.\
Players can start instantly with familiar flows, earn **points-based rewards**, and interact with KCG’s economy under clearly documented **security and governance controls**.

#### 1) UX-first onboarding (Web2-friendly)

* Start with minimal friction: fast entry, familiar UI patterns, and progressive disclosure of crypto features.
* Wallet connection is optional at first; advanced on-chain interactions are introduced only when needed.

#### 2) Points-based operation (Reward layer)

* Rewards are managed through a points-based system optimized for gameplay loops (missions, quests, rankings, seasons).
* Points are designed for stable gameplay economics and measurable engagement, with clearly documented conversion/use rules when applicable.

#### 3) Security & governance (Trust layer)

* Privileged actions and major wallets are governed under a documented security model (e.g., multisig controls, threshold approvals, and purpose-based wallet segregation).
* Official contract addresses, allocations, and audit mappings are maintained in this repository/GitBook as the single source of truth.
